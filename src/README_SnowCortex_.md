- [snowflake-in-20minutes](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tutorials/snowflake-in-20minutes)

- Create Snowflake objects—You create a database and a table for storing data.
- Install SnowSQL—You install and use SnowSQL, the Snowflake command line query tool.
Users of Visual Studio Code might consider using the Snowflake Extension for Visual Studio Code instead of SnowSQL.
- Load CSV data files—You use various mechanisms to load data into tables from CSV files.
- Write and execute sample queries—You write and execute a variety of queries against newly loaded data.

#### SnowSQL - Snowflake CLI (CLI client)

- ```Snowflake CLI``` - is an open-source command-line tool explicitly designed for developer-centric workloads in addition to SQL operations. As an alternative to SnowSQL, Snowflake CLI lets you execute SQL commands as well as execute commands for other Snowflake products like Streamlit in Snowflake, Snowpark Container Services, and Snowflake Native App Framework. Snowflake recommends that you begin transitioning from SnowSQL to Snowflake CLI.

- LINUX Install --  download, verify, and run the installer package to install SnowSQL on Linux.

#### Snowflake API Reference (Python)
- https://docs.snowflake.com/developer-guide/snowflake-python-api/reference/latest/index
- The Snowflake platform has a rich SQL command API which lets you interact with Snowflake entities, creating, deleting, modifying them, and more. The library described here, called the “Snowflake Python API” (or “SnowAPI” for short) provides the same functionality using the Python language.
